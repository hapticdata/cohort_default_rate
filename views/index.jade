			Welcome to the <a href="http://www2.ed.gov/offices/OSFAP/defaultmanagement/cdr.html">Cohort Default Rates</a> visualization. The cohort default rate is the percentage of borrowers 
			who enter repayment in a fiscal year and default by the end of the next fiscal year. 
			This site is intended to raise awareness about which schools are leaving their students unable to pay their loans
			and which institutions are creating successful futures for their student body.
			The nations average default rates for 2009 were 8.54%, 2008 was 6.31% and 2007 was 5.22%
